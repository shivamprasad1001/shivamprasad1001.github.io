# Welcome to My Digital Workshop

## About Me

Hey there! I'm **Shivam Prasad**, an AI/ML Developer with a passion for creating intelligent solutions that solve real-world problems. I work at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and creative problem-solving to build AI systems that are both powerful and practical.

When I'm not training models or debugging neural networks, you can find me exploring web development frameworks or tinkering with cybersecurity tools. I believe in a holistic approach to technology‚Äîunderstanding the full stack makes for better specialized solutions.

## Technical Focus Areas

### ü§ñ AI/ML Development

My primary focus is on machine learning and artificial intelligence, with expertise in:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) implementation and fine-tuning
- PyTorch for deep learning research and deployment
- LangChain for building context-aware AI applications
- Hugging Face ecosystem for NLP tasks and model sharing
- MLOps and model deployment pipelines

### üåê Web Development

I enjoy bringing AI solutions to life through accessible interfaces:

- Modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue)
- Backend systems that support AI inference
- RESTful and GraphQL APIs for model serving
- Performance optimization for ML in web environments

### üîí Cybersecurity

Security is a critical consideration in any AI deployment:

- Secure model deployment architectures
- Linux-based security tooling (SSH, Netcat)
- Mobile security testing with Termux
- Threat modeling for ML systems

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on:

- Building a privacy-preserving recommendation system
- Exploring efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs
- Contributing to open-source NLP tools
- Creating tutorials on secure AI deployment

## Terminal Toolbox

As someone who lives in the terminal, here are some of my favorite tools:

```bash
# Daily drivers
vim, tmux, git, docker

# Security toolkit
ssh, netcat, nmap, wireshark

# Mobile development
termux, adb, scrcpy

# ML workflow
jupyter, tensorboard, wandb
```
